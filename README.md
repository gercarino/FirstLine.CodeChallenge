# FirstLine.CodeChallenge

This project is a collection of coding exercises implemented as an ASP.NET Core MVC application. It serves as a demonstration of various MVC concepts and Razor syntax usage.
### Requirements :

+ NET 8 SDK
+ VSCode or Visual Studio 2022.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard ASP.NET Core MVC structure:

- **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests, process data, and return responses.
    - `HomeController.cs`: Manages the main page and navigation.
    - Individual controllers for each exercise (e.g., `StringToNumberController.cs`, `PalindromeController.cs`).

- **Models**: Represent the data and business logic of the application.
    - Each exercise has its own model (e.g., `StringToNumberModel.cs`, `PalindromeModel.cs`).

- **Views**: Contains the UI templates for rendering the HTML response.
    - Located in the `Views` folder, organized by controller.
    - Utilizes Razor syntax for dynamic content generation.

## Key Features

- **Razor Syntax**: Extensively used in views for server-side rendering and logic.
- **Model Binding**: Demonstrates automatic mapping of form data to model properties.
- **Data Annotations**: Used for model validation (e.g., `[Required]`, `[Range]` attributes).
- **Client-Side Validation**: Implemented using jQuery Validation and Unobtrusive Validation.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Bootstrap for a mobile-friendly layout.

## Note on Project Structure

This project serves as a basic skeleton to demonstrate MVC concepts. In a real-world scenario, it's recommended to:

1. **Separate Business Logic**: Move complex logic out of controllers into separate service classes.
2. **Use Dependency Injection**: For better modularity and testability.
3. **Implement Repository Pattern**: For data access, if working with databases.
4. **Add Logging**: Incorporate a logging framework for better debugging and monitoring.
5. **Enhance Error Handling**: Implement global error handling and custom error pages.
6. **Consider Security**: Implement authentication and authorization where necessary.
7. **Optimize Performance**: Consider caching strategies and asynchronous programming where appropriate.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE
3. Restore NuGet packages
4. Run the application

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for ASP.NET Core MVC concepts and implementation patterns.
